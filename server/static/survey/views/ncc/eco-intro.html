<h3>Project Information: Monitoring in Ecosystem Features</h3>
<p>In the North Central Coast, MPA monitoring is organized by 9 Ecosystem Features. In the following exercise, weâ€™d like to understand how your project maps onto this framework.</p>

<p>Please select the Ecosystem Feature(s) in which your project collects ecological or human use data. If your project does not collect ecological or human use data in these Ecosystem Features, please select the Contextual Data option below.</p>

<p>Please note that if you select the Contextual Data option, you will not be able to select any additional Ecosystem Features below.</p>

<p>Please also note that MPA monitoring is designed to assess both changes in ecosystem condition through time and effectiveness of MPA design and management decisions. In this survey, we are focusing on monitoring to assess changes in ecosystem condition.</p>
